respond_with doesn't show the json errors. This happens even with rails 3.2.0.rc0. Using render instead

# respond_with returns wrong JSON content for errors + AResource documentation bugs
https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3269

# JSON responder should return errors with :errors root
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/3272 (included in 3.20.rc1)


trying to find where the above pull was done: https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1
# respond_with doesn't show the errors

 -Dont't show it:
  respond_with(:errors => ['it doesn't show it'], :status => 422, :location=> nil)
 - It shows the errors
  render :json => {:errors => ['it shows it']}, :status => 400
